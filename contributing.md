# Categories

## Plugins

This category must only contain Tailwind CSS plugins that use the [official plugin architecture](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins/) to extend the framework. When adding your plugin to the list, **to the bottom**, but **ABOVE the deprecated plugins**.

## UI Libraries & Components

This category should contain UI libraries made with and for Tailwind CSS, as well as standalone components that are optimized for distribution. Components examples that are not distributable with a package manager should be in [Demos, Samples & Tutorials](README.md/#demos-samples--tutorials). When adding your item to the list, please add it **to the bottom**.

## Resources

Resources are stuff that are made with, for, or are useful for Tailwind CSS. If Tailwind CSS is not the main focus of the resource, maybe it doesn't belong to this list.

### Useful Links

This category contains resources that are official *or* widely known and used in the Tailwind CSS community. If you find something that we forgot to add here, or if you built something a while ago that has become quite popular in the community, feel free to add it. Otherwise, it most likely belongs in the other categories.

### Tools

Tools can be things that help with setting up or working with Tailwind CSS, or stuff that extend other services to bring Tailwind CSS in them. The category has tags in the form of emojis. If you find no emoji corresponding to your tool but you believe there should be one, feel free to *propose* to add one in your pull request. If there are multiple amojis that correspond to your item, you can stack them.

### Starters, Templates & Themes

This category contains boilerplates projects, starters projects and tools made for using Tailwind CSS as well as themes made with or for Tailwind CSS. When adding an item to this list, try to logically group it next to similar items. You can also stack emojis if you think it is needed.

### IDE Extensions

If you made an extension that makes the usage of Tailwind CSS easier, make sure it is properly distributable before adding it to the list. Please use the format `[<extension type/functionality> for <IDE name>](link) - <Full IDE name> <extension functionality> for Tailwind CSS` when applicable.

### Open-Source Projects

Open-source projects that use Tailwind CSS can be featured in this category if you feel that it is awesome enough. Please don't add newly-created projects though, and wait for them to get sort of popular before sending your pull request. The item must be added at the end of the list.

### Learning

Anything that is a material that can be used to better understand Tailwind CSS can be added here. Awesome blog posts, code samples, tutorials on any platform are welcome. When adding an item, please try to logically group them below other similar items, or by emoji.

### Apps & Websites

Any application, blog, or website that was built with Tailwind CSS and that is awesome enough can be added here. It must be something that features what can be done with the framework. You can promote your own stuff here, but it should be awesome enough, as it can't be a list of all Tailwind CSS websites ever. 

Descriptions here do not need to be explicit or describing the content of the website. The name of the link should be the name of the blogger, the name of the application or the title of the website. Its description can be either `<name>'s website` or **briefly** describe the owner of the site.
